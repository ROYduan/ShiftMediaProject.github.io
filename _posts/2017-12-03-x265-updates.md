The following projects have been updated:
* x265 was updated to 2.6.

There has been no ffmpeg update this or last week due to breakages in the upstream source code. Once upstream FFmpeg has fixed errors in msvc compilation then releases here will resume.

Any projects that have a dependency that was updated has also been updated to build with the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
