There have been several updates over the last week. The libiconv library has been updated to 1.15 while harfbuzz was updated to 1.4.3. The libgpg-error library was updated to 1.27, libbluray was updated to 1.0.0 and gnutls was updated to the next stable branch with a big bump up to version 3.5.9. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
