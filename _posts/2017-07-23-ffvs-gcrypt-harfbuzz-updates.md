---

The GCrypt library was updated to 1.8.0 and the Harfbuzz project was updated to version 1.4.7. The FFVS Project Generator has been getting a lot more use by others which has exposed a few more corner cases, this has lead to another bug fix update to 1.5.6. Any projects that have a dependency that was updated has also been updated to build with the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
