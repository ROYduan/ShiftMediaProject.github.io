title: GPG-error Update
---

Libgpg-error has been updated to the latest version 1.26. To correspond with this both libgcrypt and libssh have a new dash release which uses the updates to the newest gpg-error version dependency. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
