title: FFVS Project Generator, Fontconfig and GnuTLS updates
---

The Fontconfig library was updated to 2.12.4 and the GnuTLS library was updated to 3.5.14. The FFVS Project Generator had a bug fix and comptatibility update to 1.5.4. Also all releases are now built using the latest Windows SDK available on each platform. This enables support for the latest Windows 10 features (such as DXVA VP9 decoding support in ffmpeg). As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. Any projects that have a dependency that was updated has also been updated to build with the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
