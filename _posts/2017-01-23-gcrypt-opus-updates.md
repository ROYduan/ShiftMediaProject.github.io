title: LibGCrypt and Opus updates
---

LibGCrypt has now been updated to version 1.7.6 while the Opus library saw a small update to 1.1.4. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
