title: GCrypt, Game-music-emu and OpenSSL Updated
---

GCrypt has had a minor bug fix release and has been updated to version 1.7.5. Game-music-emu has been updated to 0.6.1 and OpenSSL was updated to 1.1.0c. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. No new FFmpeg build has been released as there is currently a compilation breaking error in the upstream repository that is preventing compilation with MSVC. Once this is resolved releases will continue as normal.
