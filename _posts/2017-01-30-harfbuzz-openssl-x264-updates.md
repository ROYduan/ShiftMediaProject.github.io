Harfbuzz has now been updated to version 1.4.2 while the OpenSSL library saw an update to 1.1.0d. X264 was also updated to the latest r2748 release. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
