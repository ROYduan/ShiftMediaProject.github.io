title: Harfbuzz and FFVS Project Generator updates
---

The Harfbuzz library was updated to 1.4.5 while FFVS Project Generator had a bugfix release 1.4.1. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
