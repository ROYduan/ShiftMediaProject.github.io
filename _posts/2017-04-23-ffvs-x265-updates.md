title: FFVS Project Generator and x265 updates
---

The x265 library was updated to 2.4 while FFVS Project Generator had a feature release bumping to 1.5.0. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
