title: Lame, Game-music-emu and libbluray updates
---

The following projects have been updated:
* lame mp3 was updated to 3.100.
* Game-music-emu was updated to 0.6.2.
* libbluray was updated to 1.0.2.

There is still no FFmpeg update this week as upstream still hasn't fixed the msvc compilation issues.

Any projects that have a dependency that was updated has also been updated to build with the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
