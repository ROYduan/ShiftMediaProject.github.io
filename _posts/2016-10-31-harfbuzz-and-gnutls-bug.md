title: Harfbuzz Update and GnuTLS fix
---

Harfbuzz has been updated to the latest version 1.3.3. There was also a bug discovered in the GnuTLS version provided on this site that effects some systems depending on their available cpu features. This has been fixed and the latest GnuTLS release (3.4.16) has been updated with the fixes. If you have used an older GnuTLS version then make sure you download the latest from the [Projects](/1-projects) page or update your repo with the latest changes. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
