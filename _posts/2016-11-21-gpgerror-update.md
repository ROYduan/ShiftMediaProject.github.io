title: GPG-error Update
---

Libgpg-error has been updated to the latest version 1.25. To correspond with this both libgcrypt and libssh have a new dash release which uses the updates to the newest gpg-error version dependency. The Opus project was also updated with a fix so that DLL export libs are now properly generated and the download on the release page has been apdated to include this. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
