title: FFVS Project Generator, Harfbuzz and modplug updates
---

The modplug library was updated to 0.8.9.0 while Harfbuzz was updated to 1.4.6. The FFVS Project Generator had a bug fix release bumping to 1.5.1. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
