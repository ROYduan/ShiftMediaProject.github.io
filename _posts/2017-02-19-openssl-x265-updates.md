title: OpenSSL and x264 updates
---

The OpenSSL library saw an update to 1.1.0e while X265 was also updated to the latest 2.3 release. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
