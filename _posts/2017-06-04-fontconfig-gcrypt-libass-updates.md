title: Fontconfig, gcrypt and libass updates
---

The fontconfig library was updated to version 2.12.2 and then a quick update to 2.12.3. The libgcrypt library was updated to 1.7.7 and libass was also updated to 0.13.7. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
