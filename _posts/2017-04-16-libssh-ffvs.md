title: LibSSH and FFVS Project Generator updates
---

The libssh library was updated to 0.7.5 while FFVS Project Generator is now at version 1.4.3. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
