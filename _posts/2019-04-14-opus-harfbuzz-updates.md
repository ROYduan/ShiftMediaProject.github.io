title: Opus and Harfbuzz updates
---

The following projects have been updated:
* Opus was updated to 1.3.1.
* Harfbuzz was updated to 1.3.0 and then to 1.3.1. (Note: Harfbuzz 1.4.0 will be delayed as it is no longer compilable in VS2013. As a result VS2013 support will soon be dropped when 2019 support is added)

Any projects that have a dependency that was updated has also been updated to build with the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
