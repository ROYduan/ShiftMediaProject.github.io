title: OpenSSL, Opus and x264 updates
---

The OpenSSL library was updated to 1.1.0f while Opus got a minor bug fix update to version 1.15. X264 was also updated to the latest stable r2768. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
