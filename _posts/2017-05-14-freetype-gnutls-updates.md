The Freetype library was updated to 2.8 while GnuTLS was updated to 3.8.11 then quickly updated 3.8.12. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
