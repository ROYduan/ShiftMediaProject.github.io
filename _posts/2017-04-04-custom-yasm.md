title: Custom YASM VS Integration.
---

In order to fix several compilation errors found in certain projects we have now moved to our own yasm build customizations for Visual Studio. This means that instead of using the old vsyasm files provided from the yasm site we are now using our own customizations provided here in the ShiftMediaProject repositories. The new customizations are much easier to install so for any project that uses yasm for assembly compilation you will now have to install the new yasm customizations. The instructions for doing this can be found in the readme for each affected repository.
