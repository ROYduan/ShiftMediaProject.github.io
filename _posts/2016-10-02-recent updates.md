A bunch of libraries just got updated with harfbuzz being updated to 1.3.2, nettle is now at version 3.3 and libass is as 0.13.3. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest version of these new libraries as well.
