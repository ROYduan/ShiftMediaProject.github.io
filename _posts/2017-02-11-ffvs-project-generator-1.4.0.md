title: FFVS Project Generator 1.4.0
---

The FFVS Project Generator has a new 1.4.0 release which adds several new features. The main one is that it now supports detecting missing symbols in debug builds. With the new version it can now scan the project code based on the current configuration and automatically generate stubs for the missing functions. This makes it even easier to use debug builds in Visual Studio. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest version of the new tool as well.
