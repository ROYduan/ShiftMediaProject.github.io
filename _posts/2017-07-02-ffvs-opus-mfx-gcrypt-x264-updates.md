The Opus library was updated to 1.2.1, libmfx was updated to support the latest 1.23 intel qsv api, gcrypt was updated to 1.7.8 and x264 was updated to r2795. The FFVS Project Generator also had a bump to version 1.5.3.

The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
