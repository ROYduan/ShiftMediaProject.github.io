title: Harfbuzz and GnuTLS updates
---

The Harfbuzz library was updated to 1.4.4 while GnuTLS was also updated to the latest 3.5.10 release. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
