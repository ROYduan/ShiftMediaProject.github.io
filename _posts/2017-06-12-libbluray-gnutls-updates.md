title: Libbluray and GnuTLS updates
---

The libbluray library was updated to 1.0.1 while GnuTLS was updated to 3.5.13. As always the latest releases are available on the [Projects](/1-projects) page while still allowing access to any previously supported releases. The latest FFmpeg build has also been updated to use the latest versions of the new libraries as well.
